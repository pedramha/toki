## Introduction

Everybody is riding the hype around **Microservices Architecture**, which makes sense until you realize you end up with several microservices that need to be coordinated to fulfill your business requirements.
  
Enter __toki__ and its ecosystem of modules/plugins which was born from the aforementioned necessity.
 
 
### Key Features

- __Configuration based__, bring your own modules implemeting your own business logic, install them, add them to the configuration an watch do their thing.
 
- __Web servers__, by using the different __toki-bride__ implementations you can use your favorite web server and integrate __toki__ into it.

## Installation

```
npm install toki
```

## API

See the [API Reference](http://github.com/xogroup/toki/blob/master/API.md).

## Dependencies

### toki-config

Main interface to obtain rules configuration to be executed by __toki__.  

```Javascript
//setup config
const TokiConfig = require('toki-cofig');
//I need file based config based
const tokiConfig = new TokiConfig({
    'toki-config-file' : {
        path : './config.json'
    }
});

//setup toki
const Toki = require('toki');
const toki = new Toki();
```

More on [toki-config](https://github.com/xogroup/toki-config).


### toki-logger

A logging interface that can be instantiated beforehand with any standard logging library. 
__toki__ will require the toki-logger instance to log events and actions related to it's own lifecycle and request/rule execution.

```Javascript
//setup logger
const winston = require('winston');
const TokiLogger = require('toki-logger');
const logger = TokiLogger(winston);

//setup toki
const Toki = require('toki');
const toki = new Toki();
```

## Usage

Code wise there's not a lot todo in regards to __toki__. The main concerns for you would be:

- put together your configuration as per [toki configuration](./RULESENGINE.md#configuration)

- build your action handler as per [toki action handler](./RULESENGINE.md#how-to-implement-my-very-own-action-handler) listed steps

- setup __toki__ dependencies

- require and new __toki__

- sit back and relax skynet err.. __toki__ is at the wheel

```Javascript
//setup config
const TokiConfig = require('toki-cofig');
//I need file based config based
const tokiConfig = new TokiConfig({
    'toki-config-file' : {
        path : './config.json'
    }
});

//setup logger
const winston = require('winston');
const TokiLogger = require('toki-logger');
const logger = TokiLogger(winston);

//setup toki
const Toki = require('toki');
const toki = new Toki();
```
